1 - Performed linear regression of a noisy sinewave using a set of gaussian basis
functions with learned location and scale parameters. Model parameters were
learned with stochastic gradient descent.


2 - Solved the Two Spirals Problem by performing binary classification on the spirals dataset, consisting of 3 turns, with a neural network. Network consisted of 1 hidden layer with 16 neurons, with sine used as the activation function.
